==================================

## Introduction

Sematch is a simple restful semantic matching framework used for matching structured data, including
database records, rdf intances. Sematch includes both Java and Python implementations. The Java part
integrates the lucene indexing module in order to achieve the high performance. The python parts
allows you to quick test your data and have a simple demo easily. 

It is very easy to use sematch to implement your similarity-based searching or similarity-based
recommendation modules. The data and queries are all structured attributes and values so you can use our
implemented similarity metrics to measure similarity for each attributes, then use the aggregated
similarity for searching and recommending data given a structured query.
