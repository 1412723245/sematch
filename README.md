## Introduction




## Examples

### Word Similarity

### Text Similarity

### Query Expansion

The first demo system overview is shown as below.
![overview](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74428083/sematch/overview.png)

This is the corresponding online [demo](http://demos.gsi.dit.upm.es/sematch/).
In the current prototype of sematch, you can try the following examples in your project to retrieve a list of entities using combination of keywords e.g. a entity type and a related entity.

```
	from sematch.QueryEngine import Engine
	
	engine = Engine()
	print engine.query('university Spain')
	print engine.query('lakes China')
	print engine.query('airports in France')
	print engine.query('mountains Italy')
	print engine.query('lakes United States')
```

We have provided a RESTful web server based on python Flask. By running 
```
	python SematchServer.py 
```
you can have a running web-based interface.

This project is still under development.

The project is mainly maintained by Ganggao Zhu.

##About Sematch

The name of Sematch is composed based on Spanish "se" and English "match". The logo of Sematch is based on
Chinese [Yin and Yang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) which is written
in [I Ching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching). Somehow, it correlates to 0 and 1 in computer science.
It is also the abbreviation of semantic matching because semantic similarity helps to match concepts, words,
entities semantically, instead of exact matching. Sematch aims to provide a framework to develop and evaluate
semantic similarity measures and their application for both textual corpus and structural knowledge graphs.
