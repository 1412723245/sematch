## Introduction

The name of Sematch is composed based on Spanish "se" and English "match". The logo of Sematch is based on the Chinese [Yin and Yang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) which is written in [I Ching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching). Somehow, it correlates to 0 and 1 in computer science. It is also the abbreviation of semantic matching. The sematch tool kit aims to provide you a framework for matching your required information from public Knowledge Graphs semantically. 

The first demo system overview is shown as below.

This is the corresponding online [demo](https://github.com/gsi-upm/sematch).

The goal of the sematch is to provide several core tools for applications based on Knowledge Graphs (KGs).

- semantic similarity of concepts in KG
- entity linking and disambiguation with KG
- semantic parsing
- question answering based on knowledge graph


In the current prototype of sematch, you can try the following examples in your project to retrieve a list of entities using combination of keywords e.g. a entity type and a related entity.

```
	from sematch.QueryEngine import Engine
	
	engine = Engine()
	print engine.query('university Spain')
	print engine.query('lakes China')
	print engine.query('airports in France')
	print engine.query('mountains Italy')
	print engine.query('lakes United States')
```

We have provided a RESTful web server based on python Flask. By running 
```
	python SematchServer.py 
```
you can have a running web-based interface.

This project is still under development.

The project is mainly maintained by Ganggao Zhu.
