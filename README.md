==================================

Introduction
---------------------
Classical information retrieval use the models such as Vector Space and Probabilistic, which are based on plain lexicographic term matching. However, the lack of common keywords between the query and data doesn't mean that the information is irrelevant. Semantic matching provide a possible way to match the data that user really want. In the semantic matching, we implement several algorithms for calculating the semantic similarity between concepts or terms belong to same hierarchical ontology built with Simple Knowledge Organization System(SKOS). The data are structures by Resource Description Framework(RDF). And the meta data are described into taxonomies. Consequently, the data are ranked according to their semantic similarity with the user's query. In this way, the best match of the data can be returned to user, rather than a list of information.

About this repository
------------------------------
This is the root github repository of the Semantic Matching project. Within this repository, you will find several modules for calculating the semantic similarity in a taxonomy.
