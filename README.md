==================================

## Introduction

The name of Sematch is combined based on Spanish "se" and English "match". It is also the abbreviation of semantic matching. 

The project will provide several flexible tools to ease users in using Semantic Web Data, including
entity retrieving from DBpedia based on automatic SPARQL expansion and generation, entity indexing
based on Lucene and semantic similarity.

This project is still under development. 

The project is mainly maintained by Ganggao Zhu.
